In this problem we will be following the following steps:-

1.We need to run the code for multiple test cases.Therefore,we gonna use a while loop to do so.
2.Now we can take a variable num and store the value of the input for which we to print sum of digits.
3.Now for ex: a is inputed as 123.
4.So now we gonna use a while loop because we need to use reverse the digits like if we have " 458 " as a number then we need to use an operation 3times to reverse it.
So if we use " a>0 " and continuesly decrement it it  will stops after the complete length of "a" is achieved.
5.Now most important part:
  1)We gonna take any random variable "c=0".
  2)Now we can use one more variable "m" to store the value of num%10 which is its last value(remainder).
  3)Here we took num =123 so m = 123%10 = 12.3 and 3 is stored in m as a remainder of num%10.
  4)now we declared c=0 , so now c=0*10+3 => 3 [Next time it will be 3*10+2 =>32 then next loop it will become 321].
  5)now we can delete the last number of num bcz we have added it by using num=num/10.
  
7.Now loop will continue till num's length.
8.Finally we can output the value of "c" after the loop breaks out

CODE :- 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    
    while(t--){
        int a;
        cin>>a;
        int c=0;
        while(a>0){
            int m=a%10;
            c=c*10+m;
            a=a/10;
        }
        cout<<c<<endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
