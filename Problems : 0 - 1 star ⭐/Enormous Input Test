About the problem :
So, in this problem we have to  do the following steps:
1.We gonna int 2 variables n and k.
2.We gonna use a loop and input a number == n , ex:- if n = 3 then we gonna input 3 numbers.
3.Then with the help of loop after taking a number as an input we gonna check if that number is divisible by k or not.
4.If that number is divisible by k then we will increment "count" by 1.
5.And in the final step we will output the value of count.


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int k;
    int count=0;
    int n;
    cin>>n>>k;
    int a[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        
        cin>>a[i];
        if(a[i]%k==0){
        count++;
        }
    }
    cout<<count<<endl;
    return 0;
}
