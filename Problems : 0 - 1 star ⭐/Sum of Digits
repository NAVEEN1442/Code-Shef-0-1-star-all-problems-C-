In this problem we will be following the following steps:-

1.We need to run the code for multiple test cases.Therefore,we gonna use a while loop to do so.
2.Now we can take a variable num and store the value of the input for which we to print sum of digits.
3.Now for ex: n is inputed as 123.
4.So now we gonna use a while loop because we need to use sum the digits like if we have " 458 " as a number then we need to use sum operator 3 times.
5.So if we use " num>0 " and continuesly decrement it it  will stops after the complete length of num is achieved.
6.Now most important part:
  1)We gonna take any random variable "s=0".
  2)Now we can use one more variable "m" to store the value of num%10 which is its last value(remainder).
  3)Here we took num =123 so m = 123%10 = 12.3 and 3 is stored in m as a remainder of num%10.
  4)now we declared s=0 , so now s=s+m => s=0+3 => s=3;
  5)now we can delete the last number of num bcz we we have added it by using num=num/10.
  
 7.Now loop will continue till num's length.
 8.Finally we can output the value of s after the loop breaks out

CODE :- 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int testcase,num;
    cin>>testcase;
    while(testcase--){
      cin>>num;
      int s=0;
      while(num>0){
        int m=num%10;
        s=s+m;
        num=num/10;
    }
    
    cout<<s<<endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
